## OVERVIEW

The Multi-Agent AI Blog Generator is a Streamlit web application that uses a multi-agent architecture to automatically create high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts.
Each AI agent plays a specialized role â€” from research to final content packaging â€” to ensure the final output is factual, well-structured, engaging, and ready to publish.
This project leverages the OpenAI API and the official Python SDK to orchestrate different "agents" in sequence, automating the end-to-end blog creation workflow.


## Goal / Objective

- Automate the process of researching, outlining, writing, editing, and optimizing blog posts.

- Ensure SEO best practices are followed for better search rankings.

- Provide a user-friendly interface for anyone to create professional content without technical expertise.

- Showcase multi-agent AI coordination as a real-world, portfolio-ready AI project.

## How It Works ðŸ›
